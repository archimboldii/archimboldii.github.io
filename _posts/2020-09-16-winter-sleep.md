[Winter Sleep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Sleep_(film)) is one of best movies I have ever seen, and there’s a  scene where the wife gives a monologue to her husband that I can’t stop thinking about:

> “You're actually a well-educated, honest, fair and conscientious man. Generally you are like that. I won't deny it.
> 
> But you sometimes use these virtues to suffocate people, to crush and humiliate them. Your high principles make you hate the whole world. You hate believers, because for you, believing is a sign of underdevelopment and ignorance. But you also hate non-believers for their lack of faith or ideals. You dislike the old for being conservative bigots and not thinking freely. And you dislike the young for thinking freely and abandoning the traditions. You defend the virtues of community. But you suspect everyone of being a thief or a bandit, so you hate the people, too.
> 
> You hate practically everybody. Just once, I'd like you to defend something that might cost you and have feelings that don't benefit yourself. But that's not possible.”
