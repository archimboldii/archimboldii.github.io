When Tyler Cowen interviewed Michael Pollan, he implied that Nixon thought drinking made people more conservative:

> COWEN: Do you think psychoactive drugs affect peopleâ€™s political views? Timothy Leary seemed to think they did. Nixon himself thought it made people into Commies or somehow not American. They ought to be drinking instead. That would make them more conservative.

When I think of alcohol use in conservative groups, I think of fraternities, NASCAR, sports, corporate schmoozing, and hunting. But why would alcohol be a conservative thing? It makes people more promiscuous, open to new ideas, and sometimes even acts as a gateway to harder "progressive" drugs like marijuana and LSD. It seems odd.
