Why is alcohol a conservative thing? When Tyler Cowen interviewed Michael Pollan, he implied that Nixon thought drinking made people more conservative:

> COWEN: Do you think psychoactive drugs affect peopleâ€™s political views? Timothy Leary seemed to think they did. Nixon himself thought it made people into Commies or somehow not American. They ought to be drinking instead. That would make them more conservative.

When I think of alcohol + conservative, I think of fraternities, NASCAR, sports, and hunting. But why would alcohol be a conservative thing? It makes people more promiscuous and open to new ideas. It sometimes acts as a gateway to harder "progressive" drugs like marijuana and LSD.
