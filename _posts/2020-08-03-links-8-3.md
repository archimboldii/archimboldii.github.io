        *   Business is fragile; Amazon’s success wasn’t inevitable, and in fact there have been many points in time where their success looked downright improbable.
    *   Report from Hulu on streaming behavior [link](https://advertising.hulu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Generation-Stream-Unpacking-the-Streaming-Experience.pdf)

        *   You’d certainly expect this given the hype. I’m not sure I view the two companies comparably, though. One is a marketplace, while the other is a true platform.
    *   Byrne Hobart on Jio [link](https://diff.substack.com/p/to-understand-jio-you-need-to-understand?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo0NzA4MywicG9zdF9pZCI6Nzk1MTU4LCJfIjoiY2h3bm4iLCJpYXQiOjE1OTY2MDI5MzUsImV4cCI6MTU5NjYwNjUzNSwiaXNzIjoicHViLTE5NDMwIiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.bZIaEBc5q-Mko8g56VQqWvx6LhEMJjWUrPdNAKwgQlc)
        *   “For example, in the 50s and 60s Reliance made a market in an interesting asset class: import permits. At the time, India’s protectionist policy only allowed companies to import raw materials in proportion to their exports, but not every exporter needed their quota. So Ambani cornered the market in yarn import permits—which gave him not just an asset, but the power to turn supply off and on at will. Monopolizing a commodity is always nice, but monopolizing an essential input that’s consumed by manufacturers with high fixed costs is better still; Reliance’s addressable market wasn’t just determined by the price a monopolist could charge, but by what factory owners would pay to avoid existential uncertainty.”

    *   Many features of the contemporary world arise from the growing legions of people steeped in common forms of higher education. Central features of modern society, often seen as natural, in fact hinge on the distinctive form of higher education that has become institutionalized worldwide.

    *   Cultural differences may lead to economic divergence over time as they slow down the adoption of technological and institutional innovations from the frontier countries. A one-unit rise in relative cultural distance to the frontier is associated with an increased income divergence of almost seven units.
