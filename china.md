Notes on Engineers of the Soul: Ideology in Xi Jinping's China [link](https://sinocism.com/p/engineers-of-the-soul-ideology-in)



*   This is a widely cited 2017 speech given at an internal Australian government seminar in Aug 2017.
*   The founding members of the PRC are steeped in the Dynastic System.
*   China has huge respect for the written word. Stories, histories, and teachers have great moral authority.
*   Mao was influenced by Stalin. Two important mantras: “As the revolution deepens class struggle intensifies.” and “The Party becomes strong by purging itself.”
*   Xi, Mao, and China blame Kruschev for breaking with Stalin.
*   Xi is in a war against the forces of counter-revolution that has no end point. There isn’t an objective in the sense of something a Wall Street banker might understand. Politis is the ends.
*   Stalin’s totalitarian machine worked on a predetermined path. It denies free will, abstract values like “truth”, love, and empathy. It seeks nothing less than to remould the human soul. The value of literature and art is purely instrumental, there is no such thing as art for art’s sake.
*   Xi blamed the collapse of the Soviet Union on nobody being “man enough” to stand up to Gorbachev. The party members were neglecting ideology. Xi’s warning was that China must not forget Mao, Lenin, or Stalin.
*   From Document No. 9, here is China’s thought on waging a struggle against “false trends”:
    *   Western constitutional democracy - “an attempt to undermine current leadership.”
    *   Universal values of human rights - an attempt to weaken the theoretical foundations of party leadership.
    *   Civil Society - a “political tool” of the “Western anti-China forces” dismantle the ruling party’s social foundation.
    *   Neoliberalism - US-led efforts to “change China’s basic economic system”.
    *   The West’s idea of journalism - attacking the Marxist view of news, attempting to “gouge an opening through which to infiltrate our ideology”.
    *   Historical nihilism - trying to undermine party history, “denying the inevitability” of Chinese socialism.
    *   Questioning reform and opening - No more arguing about whether reform needs to go further.
*   The Communist Party never sought to “persuade” so much as “condition”. By creating a fully enclosed system, controlling all incentives and disincentives, and “breaking” individuals physically, socially and psychologically, they found they could condition the human mind in the same way that Pavlov had learned to condition dogs in a Moscow laboratory a few years earlier.
*   The CCP exists, and therefore it is under attack. This will always be true. Without the conspiracy of Western liberalism the CCP loses its reason for existence.
*   The key point about Communist Party ideology is that the party has always defined itself as being in perpetual struggle with the “hostile” forces of Western liberalism.

Notes on Reflections on China’s Stalinist Heritage ([Part 1](https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2019/01/reflections-on-chinas-stalinist.html), [Part 2](https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2019/03/reflections-on-chinas-stalinist.html))

Part I: A Tyrant's Toolkit



*   Although Garnaut’s “Engineers of the Soul” does a good job of comparing Xi and Stalin’s ideology, Xi’s murder record is not in the same league.
*   According to Mao, what is meant by "the people" and "the enemy" are fluid concepts. The concept of "the people" varies in content in different countries and in different periods of history in a given country.
*   The West is proof that a country does not need a one-party state to become powerful and wealthy. China has two options to deal with this: a) retreat and retrench; b) face the threat head on.

Part II Just How Totalitarian is Modern China?



*   In a totalitarian regime, decisions like making love and marriage are explicitly political. Refusing to sleep with your chosen husband is an act of political rebellion. For a totalitarian: everything is political.
*   Two minimum requirements for a totalitarian system: a) all human action is considered political action; b) the system is ruled by a Party which claims commanding authority to direct all political action - and thus all human action - for its cause.
*   In Mao’s China, the personal was political. Anything anyone did was political.
*   Greer’s disagreement with Garnaut is that he believes the current Chinese system is defined by the stalinist tools and ideology its leaders have inherited - but he is not willing to call it totalitarian yet.
*   The everyday lived experience of the average Chinese is nothing like that of those who are truly under totalitarian rule. Xi has done a poor job of actually engineering the souls of China, even if he states he is doing so.
*   The average Chinese citizen can say things like “I am not interested in politics” or “I avoid politics as much as possible.” This would lead you to believe that a sphere of life that is not political does in fact exist.
*   Most Chinese are free to voice any opinion they wish so long as they do it in private. But they remember a time when they were not free to speak their minds even behind closed doors, and from this vantage point the CCP now offers a liberating experience.
*   The Chinese citizen’s focus is on the rat race.
*   As the CCP grows more vicious, hostility to its ambitions will grow. The more hostile neighbors are perceived to be, the greater the need to mobilize the masses to resist them.
