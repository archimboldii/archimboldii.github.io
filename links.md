A few of the best links on the internet. WIP.

* Lyall Taylor, [Life expectancy and the cost of capital](https://lt3000.blogspot.com/2018/02/life-expectancy-and-cost-of-capital.html)
  * The discount rate is the most important revelation in philosophy of the last 1,000 years. It isn't just time preference, it implies all sorts of things about our collective expectations for the future of humanity.

> life expectancy is actually extremely relevant to the cost of capital - perhaps the most relevant variable - and as human life expectancies have lengthened over time, it is logical to expect the cost of capital to have fallen (it is amazing to me that the economics discipline has never considered this reality - the discipline is shockingly closed-minded and ideological).

* Scott Alexander, [1960: The year the singularity was cancelled](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bYrF8rXFYwPqnfxTp/1960-the-year-the-singularity-was-cancelled)
  * Was the industrial revolution actually the beginning of infinity?

> the singularity got cancelled because we no longer have a surefire way to convert money into researchers. The old way was more money = more food = more population = more researchers. The new way is just more money = send more people to college, and screw all that.

* Dan Rasmussen, [The gospel according to Michael Porter](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b15jm11km848qm/the-gospel-according-to-michael-porter)
  * Commonly held beliefs about moats and competitive strategy don't hold up empirically.

> This consensus around Porter’s ideas in the value investing community is jarring given how controversial those theories are elsewhere. Economists at the University of Chicago have thoroughly disproven any connection between market share and profitability; antitrust law once assumed that high market share was necessarily anticompetitive, but the courts abandoned that idea in the 1980s as lacking an empirical foundation.

* Tanner Greer, [Questing for transcendence](https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2019/04/on-quests-for-transcendence.html)
  * Modernity and the meaning of life.

> Many RMs report a sense of loss and aimlessness upon returning to "the real world." They suddenly find themselves in a society that is disgustingly self-centered, a world where there is nothing to sacrifice or plan for except one's own advancement. For the past two years there was a purpose behind everything they did, a purpose whose scope far transcended their individual concerns. They had given everything—"heart, might, mind and strength"—to this work, and now they are expected to go back to racking up rewards points on their credit card? How could they?

* Time Magazine, [Lee Kuan Yew reflects](http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/printout/0,8816,1137705,00.html)
  * LKY on the United States.

> TIME: Do you like American society now?
>
> LEE: I admire American society. But I would not want to live there permanently. If I had to be a refugee, like [former South Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen] Cao Ky, who went to California, I would choose Britain, a less stressful society. [But Americans have] a can-do approach to life: everything can be broken up, analyzed, and redefined. Whether it can or it can't, Americans believe it can be solved, given enough money, research and effort. Over the years I have watched the Americans revise and restructure their economy, after they were going down in the 1980s, when Japan and Germany looked like eclipsing America, taking over all the manufacturing. Americans came roaring back. [They] have the superior system. It's more competitive.
